# Life at Lyst

Welcome! Hope you’re well. You look lovely today. 

This is where you can find out everything you need to know about Lyst: who we are, what we do, and what it’s like to work here. Scroll down for the highlights, or if you want to find out something very specific, you can search the [full Lyst handbook](https://confluence.lystit.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=327940&preview=/327940/15116145/Employee%20Handbook%20UK%20v3%20July%2017.pdf).

## Before we begin

This site has been created by us — the good people at Lyst — to introduce who we are and how we work. Its goal is to be your point of reference, whether you’re yet to join us on your Lyst journey, or you’re a founding member. This site will help you navigate your way through Lyst life and our Lyst ways, and is about the choices you’re going to be making, and how to think about them. Mainly it’s about setting you up for success and making sure you have a lot of fun whilst with us! 

We hope Life at Lyst will help to encapsulate our guiding principles, values and culture; so as Lyst continues to grow, we retain our unique spirit and keep it shining for the years ahead. 

If you are new, welcome! Now, let’s crack on…..

## The Lyst Story

Lyst was founded in 2010 by Chris, Devin and Seb. And Devin. Since then we’ve grown, explored, and made a lot of cool shit.

Lyst has 110 employees across two offices: London and New York.

## Lyst institutions

### Body and spirit

Want to get pumped? Chilled? Want to smash it, dunk it or stretch it? Whatever your goals, we want you to have a healthy body and a healthy mind.

As well as offering a discount on Virgin gym memberships, we have lots of different sport and exercise clubs: football, netball, basketball, yoga, table tennis. We sometimes play board games too - you can work up a sweat if you’re really into it.

And if you want to start a club for rock climbing, scuba diving or caber throwing, we’ll help to make it happen!

## Growing at Lyst

At Lyst we hire only the best Talent, and we’re committed to nurturing the brilliance of our people to make them even more talented! Self development and learning is key to our culture and we strive to provide opportunities for growth in everything we do, whether it’s through internal projects, hackdays or in-house training programmes. 

And, on top of all of this, we also offer a generous training budget per person. Every year, each lucky Lyster receives a training budget of £1,200, to spend on their self-development. This could be adding more tools to your toolkit, attending conferences around the world, or stocking up on books and materials! 

Find out more about how you can spend your training money here…. [training budget] (https://confluence.lystit.com/display/CUST/Training+Courses+and+Feedback)

We support continuous feedback, and think it’s important for you to receive feedback from not only your line manager, but your peers, colleagues and direct reports too. So in addition to your regular 1:1’s with your manager, and open discussions with your team, we also hold performance reviews twice a year. As part of these reviews, you’ll have the opportunity to ask others about how you’re doing, and if there’s anything you can do to further your development and growth with Lyst. It also gives you the chance to share your feedback with your manager.

## Perks and benefits

### Flexible working

We work flexibly at Lyst, as we trust that you know how best to manage your time and working week, and the last thing we want to do is force you onto the Northern Line at the peak of rush-hour!

 Our London office is open from 8am-10pm, with reception there between 9am-6pm, so we leave it to you to decide what hours work for you and your Squad. 

We know, however; that we do our best work and have our most fun when we’re together in the office as much as possible!

### Working Remotely

Lysters also have the opportunity to work remotely when we need to. Sometimes we wish to work from home or from some other random place (like a cabin, a beach or your parents' house). In the case of remote office there’s a few important pointers to keep in mind.

Check with your team first. We want to be flexible and accommodate for everyone, but sometimes we need you in the office.
Make it easy for your team to reach you, and let them know if you will be out of reach for periods of time.
Be present on Slack

### Clothing Allowance

You don’t have to dress well to work here, but we like to give you the choice! 


## Home sweet home

[London](#) / [New york](#)

Welcome to Hoxton Square.

We have about 100 people from over 30 different countries working here in sunny Shoreditch. Our office is the former White Cube art gallery. We chucked out all the paintings a few years ago and filled it up with memes and code.

You will like:
* The beautiful square. Great for walking around and around while having a meeting.
* An abundance of excellent coffee shops. So good, you’ll be caffeinated up to your eyeballs 24/7.
* Wonderful high ceilings. How tall are you? It doesn’t fucking matter, the ceilings are so high.
* Fridges full of smoked salmon and yoghurts and spinach leaves. We have fruit. We have biscuits. We have tiny individually wrapped cheeses. Have the weirdest lunch ever.
* The bars and restaurants. We go drinking a lot. Have you met Andy? You’ll meet Andy.
